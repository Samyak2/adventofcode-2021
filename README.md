# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions. I have decided to use Rust for now.

I'm new to Rust, so it might be some of the worst Rust code you've seen :)

(although if you're reading the code and know Rust, I would greatly appreciate some feedback)

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --bin day<day number with a zero padding>_<part number>
```

For example, to run Day 3 Part 2:
```bash
cargo run --bin day03_2
```

### Dependencies

Requires `cargo` and `rustc`.

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) shell:
```
nix-shell
```
